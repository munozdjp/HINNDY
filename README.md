## Hidden Identification of Nonlinear Normal form Dynamics 

A compilation of HINNDY Matlab implementations described in a research article. The implementation resembles those suggested in the paper. I've chosen to concentrate on having every implementation and detail correct.

#### Abstract

Here we explore the idea of using normal forms as universal, scalable, and minimal dynamical building blocks to capture and model the system dynamics. Our method, called HINNDy, samples observations in the vicinity of a slow manifold and formulate the problem to a constrained opti- mization problem. We evaluate performance, robustness against noise, and data requirements by benchmarking HINNDy against standard bifurcation models (Saddle-node, Transcritical, Pitchfork, Hopf). Next, we tested HINNDy for the discovery of Lorentz, Van Der Pol, the Hodgkin-Huxley, and Fitzhugh-Nagumo dynamical systems from data generated by these models.
