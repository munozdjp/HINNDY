#### Abstract
How to construct robust dynamical models for biological systems constitute a grand challenge for the systems biology community that is still unresolved. The root of the problem is partly be- cause several putative model architectures could be formulated for given biological systems, and worse the parameter space is, as a rule, massive for each model. Furthermore, we cannot assume that we have access (observations) to all relevant state variables. That is to say, hidden variables exist controlling the system, but we have no data for their temporal evolution. Therefore, incorpo- rating non- observables in the models, which may also drive the dynamical change and transitions, is usually considered prohibitively tricky. Furthermore, we may not even know the unknown vari- ables which are part of the biological system of interest. Thus, the problem of model discovery is intrinsically linked with the challenge and existence of such hidden variables.

Here we explore the idea of using normal forms as universal, scalable, and minimal dynamical building blocks to capture and model the system dynamics. Our method, called HINNDy, samples observations in the vicinity of a slow manifold and formulate the problem to a constrained opti- mization problem. We evaluate performance, robustness against noise, and data requirements by benchmarking HINNDy against standard bifurcation models (Saddle-node, Transcritical, Pitchfork, Hopf). Next, we tested HINNDy for the discovery of Lorentz, Van Der Pol, the Hodgkin-Huxley, and Fitzhugh-Nagumo dynamical systems from data generated by these models. Finally, we show that our approach generalizes to more complicated models where we do not have access to the specific model equations and hidden control variables following more sophisticated dynamic. We effectively discover the underlying equations and unobserved hidden variables from data generated from the toggle switch, genetic oscillator, and Waddington landscape model.  Thus, HINNDy en- ables data-efficient, robust robust and scalable discovery of generative non-linear models, including hidden and observed variables, capturing different dynamical regimes. In conclusion, there is grow- ing interest in the scientific community in asking how artificial intelligence and machine learning can facilitate scientific discovery. Such a quest is increasingly going beyond data analysis and pattern detection, a need for robust methods to explain natural processes within neuroscience, genomics, stem cell biology, and developmental biology. We believe that constraining the learning of models from data by using normal forms is the first step towards a more data-driven workflow to formulate systems biology models.
